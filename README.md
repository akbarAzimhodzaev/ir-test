## Comments by developer

I have used vue3 + vuex + Composition API to complete this task.
UI is checked with PerfectPixel tool and has optimized for using on mobile devices.

Selected currency persists in the browser between sessions.

Few ideas that I came up with during the task:
1. Add a line showing the price update time
2. Add link/button to force update prices
3. Store last 50-100 price positions and draw chart
4. Add Crypto currency select control
...

p.s. I didn't find Country flag icons in format provided in the design, and I've decided to use standard 4x3 format flags
